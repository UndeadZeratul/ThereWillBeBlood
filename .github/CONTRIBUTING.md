Hey there. Looks like you want to contribute with an issue. Great. Here's what you have to do:
* Have a look through the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/UndeadZeratul/ThereWillBeBlood/issues), to see if your issue has been solved already;
* Read through the steps on [Bug Reporting 101](http://vazkii.us/br101/) (You may skip this if you're already familiar with reporting issues, but it's good for newcomers);

* Note the following points:
  * When reporting an issue, please include the version of the modpack (can be found on the title screen), which launcher you are using, and a link to pastebin with any crash report you have received.
  * Issues regarding outdated versions of the modpack are **not accepted**;
  * Duplicate issues or issues that have been solved already (use the search feature!) will be closed without asking.
  * Do not tag your issues' names. "Something Broke" is prefered to "[Bug] Something Broke"  because there's a proper label system in place.
  * If you are going to post a suggestion, post one, not a wish list; it’s easier to track and manage that way.

The following "bugs" are not accepted:
* Intended Behaviour
  * Constantly dying.
* Not a TWBB problem/Not fixable
  * Crash on startup with any mod that isn’t [in this list](https://github.com/UndeadZeratul/ThereWillBeBlood/blob/master/Versions.md)
  * Flowers don't render (Optifine issue)

If you want to make a Pull Request keep these in mind:
* Do not use the github editor. Test your PRs before you submit them.
* Unless you have a very good reason for it, keep your PRs all in one commit. You can do it with [rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).
